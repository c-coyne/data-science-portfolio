# Applied Data Analysis
## Cure-in-Place Gasket Process Capability

This project examines data from a capability study on a liquid-dispensed cure-in-place gasket (CIPG), which is a gasket technology that is applied to the architecture as a liquid, cures in place, then acts as a serviceable compression gasket for the duration of the assembly lifetime. The dataset collected consists of 4,574 measurements (per part) of (1) gasket dry height, (2) gasket dry width, (3) gasket dry area, (4) gasket wet height, (5) gasket wet width, and (6) gasket wet area. There are five parts considered in this study. Samples 2-5 were measured both wet and dry, and Sample 1 was measured only dry. Therefore, the resulting dataset has 128,072 datapoints. The results of this analysis are then used to prepare for high-volume production of automotive high-voltage battery packs.
