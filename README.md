# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio of data science projects that I completed either for professional purposes or for self-development and education. I completed most projects in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, but a few use other laguages (such as C++ / Arduino).

### Machine Learning

   - Linear Regression Analysis (US Small Cities' Health): A univariate linear regression model developed via gradient descent techniques for cost function optimization to identify and predict relationships between the death rate in US small towns as a function of various healthcare metrics. This project includes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and various statitical tools, such as hypothesis testing.
  - Multi-Class Classification (Handwritten Digits): A logistic regression multi-class classifier model trained and tested to read handwritten digits. The model is built from scratch and includes a discussion of the sigmoid hypothesis function, constituents of the cost function, vectorization, and model assessment if the model were to be improved.
  - Support Vector Machines (Heart Disease Diagnosis): A support vector machine (SVM) classifier built to diagnose heart disease in patients based on other patient health information. The project includes an example linear and non-linear 2D SVM classifier to exemplify the concept, then applies the same principles to a 13-attribute dataset. The hyperparameters are then optimized to improve model performance.
