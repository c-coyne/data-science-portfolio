# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio of data science projects that I completed either for professional purposes or for self-development and education. I completed all projects in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Contents
- Machine Learning
   - Linear Regression Analysis (US Small Cities' Health): A univariate linear regression model developed via machine learning techniques to identify and predict relationships between the death rate in US small towns as a function of various healthcare metrics. This project includes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and various statitical tools, such as hypothesis testing.
  - Multi-Class Classification (Handwritten Digits): A logistic regression multi-class classifier model trained and tested to read handwritten digits. The model is built from scratch and includes a model assessment if the model were to be improved.
