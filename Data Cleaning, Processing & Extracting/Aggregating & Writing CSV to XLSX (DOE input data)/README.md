# Data Cleaning, Processing & Extracting
## Aggregating & Writing CSV to XLSX (DOE input data)

This project automates the process of collecting raw data from many CSV files, cleaning the dataset to remove irrelevant / non-useful data, and copying the results to a spreadsheet. In this application, this data cleaning exercise is conducted in preparation for an engineering Design of Experiments (DoE) analysis on liquid-dispensed automotive gaskets. This Python script uses pandas and the xlsxwriter library to read CSV files and write to an XLSX file, respectively.
