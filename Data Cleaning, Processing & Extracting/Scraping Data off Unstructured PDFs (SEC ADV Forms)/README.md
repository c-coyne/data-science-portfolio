# Data Cleaning, Processing & Extracting
## Scraping Data off Unstructured PDFS (SEC ADV Forms)

This project automates the process of scanning through ADV (Uniform Application for Investment Adviser Registration and Report by Exempt Reporting Advisers) Forms from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) used by a New York consulting firm. This Python script uses the Tika library to parse PDFs and RegEx to automatically find and pull the data of interest.
