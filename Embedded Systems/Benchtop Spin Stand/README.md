## Benchtop Spin Stand

This project included the design, development, sourcing, fabrication & testing of all mechanical, electrical, and software components of a benchtop spin stand designed to evaluate gasket retention performance when subjected to typical shipping load conditions and configurations. Presented here are pictures of the of the 3D-printed final assembly (mechanical), full schematic (electrical), and Arduino (C++) code that enables stand-alone operation with custom user input (software).
