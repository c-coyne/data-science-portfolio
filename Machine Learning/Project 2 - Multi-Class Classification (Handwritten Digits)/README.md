# Project 2: Logistic Regression Multi-Class Classification
## Handwritten Digits

This project uses one-vs-rest multi-class classification to recognize handwritten numbers. This kind of multi-class classification problem can be accomplished rather succinctly with pre-built Python libraries and Google API's. This project, however, builds the recognition model from scratch using a vectorized cost and gradient descent functions and a set of logistic regression classifiers. The data used is generated using the scikit-learn library.
