# Project 3: Support Vector Machines
## Diagnosing Heart Disease

This project uses a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to diagnose heart disease in patients given a variety of medical data ([data source](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)). We first build example linear and non-linear SVM classifiers on 2D data to visualize the concept, then apply the same principles to higher-dimensional patient healthcare information. The dataset includes 13 different attributes, including factors such as age, gender, resting heart rate, fasting blood sugar, presence of exercise-induced angina, etc. Finally, we evaluate the model, tune hyperparameters to improve performance, and assess model implementation based on application.
